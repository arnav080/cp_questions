# Question: 
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.

    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
